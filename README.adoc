== What Is This?

It's a simple little tool for passing around collections of variable stuctured data.

90% of the reason I built it was because I got very tired of writing `isset()`, etc, conditionals when _the nonexistence of a key was equivalent to a falsey value in terms of program flow_.
It grew from there to provide some other functionality related to moving collections of structure data around.
I find it particularly useful when templating with https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/blade[Laravel Blade].

(Brief is only one way to solve the issues I might use here as examples:
It's not intended to be an authoritative or "best" solution, merely a convenient one, if you find it convenient.)

== How Does It Work?

[source,php]
----
$Brief = Brief::make([
    'key' => 'value',
]);

$Brief->key;
// 'value'

$Breif->doesnt_exist;
// null
----

Instead of throwing an error or exception, Brief will return `null` if a key does not have an associated value.

[NOTE]
====
You can also create a Brief with `new`, `make()` is just slightly more concise:
[source,php]
----
$Brief = new Brief([
    'key' => 'value',
]);
----
